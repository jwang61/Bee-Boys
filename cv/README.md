# Overview

For the computer vision component of the project, OpenCV 3.4 is used. Installation process can be found [here](https://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html).

The main algorithm uses [Haar Cascade Classifiers](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/dc/d88/tutorial_traincascade.html), which is a very traditional object detection framework.

A sample script (copied from OpenCV) can be found in `sample`.
